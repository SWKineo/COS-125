COS 125 Trac/SVN Project Organization

This repository has been organized as follows

/trunk - this is the root of your project directory structure 
  all of your code should go here. If you use subdirectories 
  (for example, images) then they should also be placed in trunk 
  
Normally you would use other tools such as the wiki 
for managing documents. But because svn tracks document history 
(who committed files and when) please use the following 
folders instead.

projectdocs/
	Store your project documents (design document, testing 
	document, and review document) here. You may want to include 
	other documents and files; for example graphics used for 
	poster prep. When ready to submit documents for grading, 
	upload them to Blackboard also
	
teamdocs/
	Store your team documents here (team homework, 
	weekly reports, any other assorted documents). 
	Hoemwork and reports need to be uploaded to Blackboard also.
